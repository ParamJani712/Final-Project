# Paper Airplane Numerical Study
 Final Project: AEM 3103 Spring 2024

 By: Param Jani

 ## Summary of Finding
 Parameter         |   Nominal Value   |   Lower Value   |    Higher Value 
 Initial Velocity  |   3.55 m/s        |   1.55 m/s      |    11.05 m/s
 Flight Path Angle |   -0.18 rad       |   -0.68 rad     |    0.22 rad

In this study, I examined the flight properties of a paper airplane and understood how varying initial conditions affect its trajectory. I was able to do this using numerical simulation methods. I few important observations I made are:
1. Varying initial conditions result in visible changes in the glider's trajectory. Higher velocities lead to higher range and altitude values.
2. Flight path angles seem to affect the shape and steepiness of the trajectory, affecting the landing.

1. finalproject.m: This is the main script file with all the codes for flight path simulation

2. EqMotion.m: This is a function I used to calculate the equations of motion of the airplane.
